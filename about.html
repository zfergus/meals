Meals is an useful and simple meal budgeting tool. After providing a starting and 
current balance, and a end date for the budget period, Meals will calculate some
helpful averages and statistical data. Amongst this data is a recommended daily 
average of money to spend each day in order to spend all of the alloted funds 
before the end of the period. Meals also provides a value for the weekly and 
monthly balance remaining.<br>
